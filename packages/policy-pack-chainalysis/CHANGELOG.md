### Major Changes

- b2d2c19: feat(chainalysis)!: pack-side namespacing for composite-policy-packs (NEWT-1539 Phase 0 Stream B)

  Fourth Stream B per-pack PR. Replicates the pattern locked in
  [#41 (vaultsfyi)](https://github.com/newt-foundation/newton-policy-packs/pull/41).

  What changed in `chainalysis/`:

  - `policy.js` wraps both return paths under `PACK_ID = "chainalysis"`
    via a local `wrapOutput(packId, valueOrError)` helper.
  - `policy.js` reads inputs through an unwrap shim
    (`parsed[PACK_ID] ?? parsed`) and strips its own slot from `_secrets`
    before `loadHostSecrets()`.
  - `policy.rego` reads from `data.wasm.chainalysis.<field>`. Load-bearing
    case for chainalysis: vaultsfyi emits `risk_score` as a number,
    chainalysis emits it as a string — pre-namespacing these would silently
    clobber under `merge_jsons` last-wins.
  - New `wrapping_test.rego` (TDD-first) asserts each deny rule reads from
    `data.wasm.chainalysis.*`; flat input does NOT trigger any deny
    (silent-skip pattern — every chainalysis deny rule has an explicit
    precondition that fails-skip when `v` is undefined); cross-pack
    composition with vaultsfyi's `risk_score: 10` (number) and blockaid's
    `classification: "Malicious"` does not affect chainalysis's deny set.
  - `policy_test.rego` (existing 10 tests) wraps fixtures under the
    `chainalysis` key.
  - New `packages/policy-pack-chainalysis/src/pack-id.test.ts` asserts
    `PACK_ID === PACK_NAME === "chainalysis"`.
  - `scripts/lint-policy-js.allowlist.json` drops chainalysis's 2
    grandfathered entries (lines 126, 137).

  Out of scope (deferred to later streams):

  - WASM rebuild via `jco componentize` and on-chain redeploy → Stream D.
  - npm publish of the major bump → Stream E.
  - HTTP status check is already present in chainalysis's `getJson` /
    `getSanctionsResult` / `getAddressScreening` (status >= 400 throws);
    no cross-pack input hardening needed for this pack.
  - `OracleModule` interface + per-pack export → Phase 1 (NEWT-1540).
  - Composite manifest format + decode helpers → Phase 1.5 (NEWT-1541).
  - `defineComposite` builder + Shield SDK migration → Phase 2 (NEWT-1542).

### Patch Changes

- c9b1566: chore: Stream D Sepolia redeploy for namespaced WASM (NEWT-1539 Phase 0 Stream D)

  On-chain follow-up to the Stream B per-pack source rewrites
  ([#41–#49](https://github.com/newt-foundation/newton-policy-packs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+NEWT-1539+is%3Amerged)).
  Re-componentizes each `policy.js` (now namespaced under `PACK_ID`) and
  deploys fresh `INewtonPolicy` + `INewtonPolicyData` pairs on Ethereum
  Sepolia (chain id 11155111). Bindings (`packages/policy-pack-<pack>/src/deployments.ts`)
  and the canonical `deployments.json` are updated to point at the new
  addresses; old pre-namespacing addresses are dropped from the registry
  per ADR 0003 force-migration.

  Per-pack address changes are visible in `deployments.json`. WASM CIDs
  and `policyCodeHash` values are also updated since the post-namespacing
  WASM bytes hash differently.

  No SDK API changes. Existing consumers on `@^1.x` will resolve to the
  new `Deployment` constants on upgrade — `createShield(...)` continues to
  work without code changes on the curator side.

  Out of scope:

  - npm publish of the patch bump → PR #40 (Stream E auto-publish).
  - `OracleModule` interface + per-pack export → Phase 1 (NEWT-1540).
  - Composite manifest format + decode helpers → Phase 1.5 (NEWT-1541).
  - `defineComposite` builder + Shield SDK migration → Phase 2 (NEWT-1542).

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- e0f5b97: Add hand-written `pack.ts` exporting `chainalysis: PolicyPack<Params, WasmArgs, Secrets>` so curators can pass it directly to `createShield(...)` from `@newton-xyz/newton-shield-sdk`. `prepareQuery` reads the screened wallet `address` from the SDK's per-call options bag (typically `IntentArgs.from`).

  Encoding for the on-chain `policyParams` blob uses the canonical `encodePolicyParams` / `decodePolicyParams` utility from `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-shared@^0.2.0` — see NEWT-1516.

  NEWT-1507.

- ff7092a: Lift `policyParams` encoding from per-pack `encodeParams` / `decodeParams` into a single canonical utility in `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-shared`. Wire format is **UTF-8 JSON with sorted keys**, which is what the AVS host already reads (`String::from_utf8 → serde_json::from_str` at `newton-prover-avs/crates/core/src/common/task.rs:402-408`). NEWT-1516.

  **Breaking — `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-shared`**: the `PolicyPack` interface no longer requires per-pack `encodeParams` / `decodeParams`. New exports `encodePolicyParams(pack, params): Hex` and `decodePolicyParams(pack, encoded): T` replace them. Sorted keys mean the same params object always produces byte-identical output, so SDK-side `verifyPolicyBinding` can byte-compare against `getPolicyConfig().policyParams`. Both functions validate via the pack's `paramsSchema`, so a curator typo or a corrupted on-chain blob throws at the SDK boundary rather than producing AVS-rejecting bytes.

  **Breaking — `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-vaultsfyi`**: dropped the pack-local ABI encoder. The on-chain wire format is now JSON, not Solidity ABI bytes. `vaultsfyi@0.2.0` was non-functional end-to-end against the AVS — it shipped `encodeAbiParameters` output that the AVS parsed as `{}` and rejected every call. Anyone who ran `setPolicy(vaultsfyi.encodeParams(...))` against the on-chain `NewtonPolicy` is on a broken clone and needs to re-issue `setPolicy` with `encodePolicyParams(vaultsfyi, params)` from the new shared package. The `RefinedParamsSchema` (sub-basis-point precision rejection) is preserved as curator-side input validation.

  This change intentionally cascades majors to all dependent packs per ADR 0001 (`docs/architecture/0001-policy-pack-shared-as-peer-dep.md`) — see "Major-bump for breaking shared changes intentionally cascades. Don't dodge that case." Follow-up tickets NEWT-1505 — NEWT-1512 add hand-written `pack.ts` files to the 8 bindings-only packs against the new interface.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ef623e9: First public release as bindings-only packages (M4 follow-up).

  Drops `"private": true` from all 8 bindings-only policy-pack packages so they publish to npm at `0.1.0`. Each package ships:

  - `ParamsSchema` (zod) + `Params` (type) — `encodeParams` is **not** included; curators encode `policyParams` themselves until the per-pack `pack.ts` lands.
  - `WasmArgsSchema` (zod) + `WasmArgs` (type) — per-call args the AVS WASM receives.
  - `SecretsSchema` (zod) + `Secrets` (type) — credentials uploaded before run/sim.
  - `deployments` — `chainId → { policy, policyData, wasmCid, ... }` map.
  - `PACK_NAME` / `PACK_VERSION` / `PACK_DESCRIPTION` / `PACK_LINK` / `PACK_AUTHOR` — static identity from `policy_metadata.json`.

  These packs do **not** export a canonical `PolicyPack` object yet, so they can't be passed to `createShield(...)` from `@newton-xyz/newton-shield-sdk`. Curators use the bindings with `NewtonShield.guardedCall` directly. Each pack's README documents this limitation.

  The per-pack `pack.ts` work is filed as a separate ticket per pack and is blocked on resolving the canonical `policyParams` encoding (UTF-8 JSON vs Solidity ABI tuple — see [NEWT-1516](https://linear.app/magiclabs/issue/NEWT-1516)). They'll land once that decision is made and curators show demand.
