# @newton-xyz/policy-pack-guardrail

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- ffffa7f: Add hand-written `pack.ts` exporting `guardrail: PolicyPack<Params, WasmArgs, Secrets>` so curators can pass it directly to `createShield(...)` from `@newton-xyz/newton-shield-sdk`. `prepareQuery` populates `vaultAddress` from `PrepareQueryArgs.vault` and `chainId` from `publicClient.chain.id`; curators that prefer Guardrail's protocol-level alerts can pass `protocolId` via the options bag.

  Encoding for the on-chain `policyParams` blob uses the canonical `encodePolicyParams` / `decodePolicyParams` utility from `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-shared@^0.2.0` — see NEWT-1516.

  NEWT-1508.

- ff7092a: Lift `policyParams` encoding from per-pack `encodeParams` / `decodeParams` into a single canonical utility in `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-shared`. Wire format is **UTF-8 JSON with sorted keys**, which is what the AVS host already reads (`String::from_utf8 → serde_json::from_str` at `newton-prover-avs/crates/core/src/common/task.rs:402-408`). NEWT-1516.

  **Breaking — `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-shared`**: the `PolicyPack` interface no longer requires per-pack `encodeParams` / `decodeParams`. New exports `encodePolicyParams(pack, params): Hex` and `decodePolicyParams(pack, encoded): T` replace them. Sorted keys mean the same params object always produces byte-identical output, so SDK-side `verifyPolicyBinding` can byte-compare against `getPolicyConfig().policyParams`. Both functions validate via the pack's `paramsSchema`, so a curator typo or a corrupted on-chain blob throws at the SDK boundary rather than producing AVS-rejecting bytes.

  **Breaking — `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-vaultsfyi`**: dropped the pack-local ABI encoder. The on-chain wire format is now JSON, not Solidity ABI bytes. `vaultsfyi@0.2.0` was non-functional end-to-end against the AVS — it shipped `encodeAbiParameters` output that the AVS parsed as `{}` and rejected every call. Anyone who ran `setPolicy(vaultsfyi.encodeParams(...))` against the on-chain `NewtonPolicy` is on a broken clone and needs to re-issue `setPolicy` with `encodePolicyParams(vaultsfyi, params)` from the new shared package. The `RefinedParamsSchema` (sub-basis-point precision rejection) is preserved as curator-side input validation.

  This change intentionally cascades majors to all dependent packs per ADR 0001 (`docs/architecture/0001-policy-pack-shared-as-peer-dep.md`) — see "Major-bump for breaking shared changes intentionally cascades. Don't dodge that case." Follow-up tickets NEWT-1505 — NEWT-1512 add hand-written `pack.ts` files to the 8 bindings-only packs against the new interface.

### Minor Changes

- 960a432: Close fail-open paths in blockaid, guardrail, and webacy allow rules.

  - **blockaid**: switch from `classification != "Malicious"` to a positive allowlist `{"Benign", "Warning"}`. The previous check let `"Unknown"` (the parse-failure default in policy.js) and any future Blockaid result type pass. Adds a `blockaid_unknown_classification` deny tag.
  - **guardrail**: add a required `require_health` boolean param (default true on the operator side) and require `health_available == true` whenever it is set. The previous `health_ok if v.health_available == false` clause turned every health-endpoint outage into an allow. Adds a `guardrail_health_unavailable` deny tag.
  - **webacy**: gate allow on `within_expected_range == true` and a new required `max_abs_dev_pct` param against `abs_dev_clean`. Tokens currently outside their peg range with no recent depeg events / no streak / non-stale data previously passed silently. Also tightens `wasm_args` `lookback_days` to a hard `[1, 30]` range — out-of-range inputs now throw in the WASM (rego denies via `default allow := false`) instead of being silently clamped.

  Operators must set the new params (`require_health`, `max_abs_dev_pct`) when binding these policies; missing required params will fail validation.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ef623e9: First public release as bindings-only packages (M4 follow-up).

  Drops `"private": true` from all 8 bindings-only policy-pack packages so they publish to npm at `0.1.0`. Each package ships:

  - `ParamsSchema` (zod) + `Params` (type) — `encodeParams` is **not** included; curators encode `policyParams` themselves until the per-pack `pack.ts` lands.
  - `WasmArgsSchema` (zod) + `WasmArgs` (type) — per-call args the AVS WASM receives.
  - `SecretsSchema` (zod) + `Secrets` (type) — credentials uploaded before run/sim.
  - `deployments` — `chainId → { policy, policyData, wasmCid, ... }` map.
  - `PACK_NAME` / `PACK_VERSION` / `PACK_DESCRIPTION` / `PACK_LINK` / `PACK_AUTHOR` — static identity from `policy_metadata.json`.

  These packs do **not** export a canonical `PolicyPack` object yet, so they can't be passed to `createShield(...)` from `@newton-xyz/newton-shield-sdk`. Curators use the bindings with `NewtonShield.guardedCall` directly. Each pack's README documents this limitation.

  The per-pack `pack.ts` work is filed as a separate ticket per pack and is blocked on resolving the canonical `policyParams` encoding (UTF-8 JSON vs Solidity ABI tuple — see [NEWT-1516](https://linear.app/magiclabs/issue/NEWT-1516)). They'll land once that decision is made and curators show demand.
