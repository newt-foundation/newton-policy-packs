- f11252c: feat(shared): add env axis to deployments shape (NEWT-1539 Phase 0 follow-up)

  The same `(pack, chainId)` cell can now hold separate deployments under
  each Newton AVS env (`stagef`, `prod`). The Newton Gateway routes per-env
  to distinct TaskManager addresses + operator sets; the same pack policy
  deployed under `stagef` will not be evaluated by `prod` operators and
  vice versa. The previous shape — one `Deployment` per `chainId` —
  forced curators to override `policyClientAddress` to switch envs.

  Schema changes (no production consumers, clean migration):

  - `policy-pack-shared`:
    - New `GatewayEnv = "stagef" | "prod"` type export.
    - `PolicyPack.deployments` is now `Partial<Record<ChainId, Partial<Record<GatewayEnv, Deployment>>>>`
      (was `Partial<Record<ChainId, Deployment>>`).
    - `getDeployment(pack, chainId, env)` adds the env arg.
    - New `UnsupportedEnvError` distinguishes "this chain has entries but
      not the env you asked for" from `UnsupportedChainError`. The
      recovery is different: the curator either picks a different env
      (typo / wrong gateway) or asks the AVS team to deploy the pack
      into that env.
    - 5 new test cases in `pack.test.ts` covering hit / single-env / chain-miss
      / env-miss / multi-chain-error branches.
  - `deployments.json` schema bumped v1 → v2:
    - `packs.<name>["11155111"]` was a flat `Deployment`; now it's
      `{ stagef: Deployment, prod?: Deployment }`. Existing 9 stagef
      Sepolia entries migrated under `.stagef` keys.
    - New top-level `envs` map labels each AVS env.
  - `scripts/sync-deployments.sh`: `--env <stagef|prod>` is now required.
    No safe default — the env is part of the cell key.
  - `scripts/generate-bindings.ts`: `emitDeployments` outputs the new
    env-keyed shape; per-pack `src/deployments.ts` regenerated.

  `pnpm changeset status` will warn that the per-pack peer-dep references
  `^0.4.0` while the latest released `policy-pack-shared` is `0.3.0`. This
  is expected — the warning compares against the _published_ version, not
  the pending bump in this PR. Once the changesets bot publishes the
  release PR, the warning resolves itself.

  The `gen:bindings` step emits files with biome-default formatting
  (2-space, double-quoted keys); committed sources use the project's
  biome config (tabs, unquoted keys where valid). The canonical
  post-codegen step is `pnpm gen:bindings && pnpm lint:fix` — running
  either in isolation produces a partial state.

  Out of scope:

  - Shield SDK migration to the new `getDeployment` signature → newton-shield PR.
  - Deploys for the new `(chainId, env)` cells (Sepolia/prod, Base Sepolia/stagef,
    Base Sepolia/prod) → Stream D2 follow-up.
  - `OracleModule` interface + per-pack export → Phase 1 (NEWT-1540).
  - Composite manifest format + decode helpers → Phase 1.5 (NEWT-1541).
  - `defineComposite` builder → Phase 2 (NEWT-1542).

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- ff5b0f9: feat(redstone)!: pack-side namespacing for composite-policy-packs (NEWT-1539 Phase 0 Stream B)

  Seventh Stream B per-pack PR. Replicates the pattern locked in
  [#41 (vaultsfyi)](https://github.com/newt-foundation/newton-policy-packs/pull/41).

  What changed in `redstone/`:

  - `policy.js` wraps both return paths under `PACK_ID = "redstone"` via
    inline `wrapOutput` (indirect-return). Input-unwrap shim. `_secrets`
    cleanup.
  - `policy.rego` reads from `data.wasm.redstone.<field>`.
  - New `wrapping_test.rego` (TDD-first) — redstone uses the silent-skip
    negative-shape pattern (every deny rule uses `>` / `>=` comparisons
    that fail-skip on undefined `v.<field>`). Same shape as
    vaultsfyi/balancer/chainalysis. Flat-input assertion is
    `count(deny) == 0`.
  - `policy_test.rego` (existing 11 tests) wraps fixtures under the
    `redstone` key.
  - New `packages/policy-pack-redstone/src/pack-id.test.ts` asserts
    `PACK_ID === PACK_NAME === "redstone"`.
  - `scripts/lint-policy-js.allowlist.json` drops redstone's 2
    grandfathered entries (lines 119, 132).

  Out of scope:

  - WASM rebuild → Stream D. npm publish → Stream E.
  - HTTP status check is NOT yet present in redstone's `getJson`/`postJson`.
    Tracked as part of the cross-pack input-validation hardening sweep.
  - `OracleModule` / manifest / `defineComposite` → Phases 1, 1.5, 2.

### Patch Changes

- c9b1566: chore: Stream D Sepolia redeploy for namespaced WASM (NEWT-1539 Phase 0 Stream D)

  On-chain follow-up to the Stream B per-pack source rewrites
  ([#41–#49](https://github.com/newt-foundation/newton-policy-packs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+NEWT-1539+is%3Amerged)).
  Re-componentizes each `policy.js` (now namespaced under `PACK_ID`) and
  deploys fresh `INewtonPolicy` + `INewtonPolicyData` pairs on Ethereum
  Sepolia (chain id 11155111). Bindings (`packages/policy-pack-<pack>/src/deployments.ts`)
  and the canonical `deployments.json` are updated to point at the new
  addresses; old pre-namespacing addresses are dropped from the registry
  per ADR 0003 force-migration.

  Per-pack address changes are visible in `deployments.json`. WASM CIDs
  and `policyCodeHash` values are also updated since the post-namespacing
  WASM bytes hash differently.

  No SDK API changes. Existing consumers on `@^1.x` will resolve to the
  new `Deployment` constants on upgrade — `createShield(...)` continues to
  work without code changes on the curator side.

  Out of scope:

  - npm publish of the patch bump → PR #40 (Stream E auto-publish).
  - `OracleModule` interface + per-pack export → Phase 1 (NEWT-1540).
  - Composite manifest format + decode helpers → Phase 1.5 (NEWT-1541).
  - `defineComposite` builder + Shield SDK migration → Phase 2 (NEWT-1542).

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- e8e3882: Add hand-written `pack.ts` exporting `redstone: PolicyPack<Params, WasmArgs, Secrets>` so curators can pass it directly to `createShield(...)` from `@newton-xyz/newton-shield-sdk`. `prepareQuery` accepts the curator-configured `symbol`, `rpcUrl`, `onchainOracle` (`{ address, selector, decimals? }`), optional `provider`, and the prior-call `prevSnapshot` (`{ divergenceBp, timestampMs }`) via the per-call options bag. The snapshot drives sustained-divergence tracking — mirrors VaultsFYI's `previousAllocationHash` freshness pattern.

  Encoding for the on-chain `policyParams` blob uses the canonical `encodePolicyParams` / `decodePolicyParams` utility from `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-shared@^0.2.0` — see NEWT-1516.

  NEWT-1510.

- ff7092a: Lift `policyParams` encoding from per-pack `encodeParams` / `decodeParams` into a single canonical utility in `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-shared`. Wire format is **UTF-8 JSON with sorted keys**, which is what the AVS host already reads (`String::from_utf8 → serde_json::from_str` at `newton-prover-avs/crates/core/src/common/task.rs:402-408`). NEWT-1516.

  **Breaking — `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-shared`**: the `PolicyPack` interface no longer requires per-pack `encodeParams` / `decodeParams`. New exports `encodePolicyParams(pack, params): Hex` and `decodePolicyParams(pack, encoded): T` replace them. Sorted keys mean the same params object always produces byte-identical output, so SDK-side `verifyPolicyBinding` can byte-compare against `getPolicyConfig().policyParams`. Both functions validate via the pack's `paramsSchema`, so a curator typo or a corrupted on-chain blob throws at the SDK boundary rather than producing AVS-rejecting bytes.

  **Breaking — `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-vaultsfyi`**: dropped the pack-local ABI encoder. The on-chain wire format is now JSON, not Solidity ABI bytes. `vaultsfyi@0.2.0` was non-functional end-to-end against the AVS — it shipped `encodeAbiParameters` output that the AVS parsed as `{}` and rejected every call. Anyone who ran `setPolicy(vaultsfyi.encodeParams(...))` against the on-chain `NewtonPolicy` is on a broken clone and needs to re-issue `setPolicy` with `encodePolicyParams(vaultsfyi, params)` from the new shared package. The `RefinedParamsSchema` (sub-basis-point precision rejection) is preserved as curator-side input validation.

  This change intentionally cascades majors to all dependent packs per ADR 0001 (`docs/architecture/0001-policy-pack-shared-as-peer-dep.md`) — see "Major-bump for breaking shared changes intentionally cascades. Don't dodge that case." Follow-up tickets NEWT-1505 — NEWT-1512 add hand-written `pack.ts` files to the 8 bindings-only packs against the new interface.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [ff7092a]
  - @newton-xyz/policy-pack-shared@0.2.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ef623e9: First public release as bindings-only packages (M4 follow-up).

  Drops `"private": true` from all 8 bindings-only policy-pack packages so they publish to npm at `0.1.0`. Each package ships:

  - `ParamsSchema` (zod) + `Params` (type) — `encodeParams` is **not** included; curators encode `policyParams` themselves until the per-pack `pack.ts` lands.
  - `WasmArgsSchema` (zod) + `WasmArgs` (type) — per-call args the AVS WASM receives.
  - `SecretsSchema` (zod) + `Secrets` (type) — credentials uploaded before run/sim.
  - `deployments` — `chainId → { policy, policyData, wasmCid, ... }` map.
  - `PACK_NAME` / `PACK_VERSION` / `PACK_DESCRIPTION` / `PACK_LINK` / `PACK_AUTHOR` — static identity from `policy_metadata.json`.

  These packs do **not** export a canonical `PolicyPack` object yet, so they can't be passed to `createShield(...)` from `@newton-xyz/newton-shield-sdk`. Curators use the bindings with `NewtonShield.guardedCall` directly. Each pack's README documents this limitation.

  The per-pack `pack.ts` work is filed as a separate ticket per pack and is blocked on resolving the canonical `policyParams` encoding (UTF-8 JSON vs Solidity ABI tuple — see [NEWT-1516](https://linear.app/magiclabs/issue/NEWT-1516)). They'll land once that decision is made and curators show demand.
