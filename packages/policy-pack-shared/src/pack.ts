/**
 * Canonical typed contract every published `@newton-xyz/policy-pack-<name>`
 * package implements. `@newton-xyz/newton-shield-sdk`'s `createShield(...)`
 * accepts `PolicyPack<P, W, S>` as the curator's pack argument.
 *
 * Type parameters:
 * - `TParams`   — the shape stored on-chain in `NewtonPolicyData.policyParams`
 *                  (e.g. risk envelope thresholds for VaultsFYI).
 * - `TWasmArgs` — the shape passed to the policy's WASM oracle at evaluation
 *                  time (e.g. `{ vault, network, lastKnownAllocationHash }`).
 * - `TSecrets`  — required API credentials uploaded before any run/sim.
 *
 * The fields:
 * - `id`             — stable identifier of the form `<pack>/<purpose>/<version>`,
 *                       e.g. `vaultsfyi/risk-envelope/v1`. Used for telemetry
 *                       and for cross-referencing the `policy_metadata.json`.
 * - `paramsSchema`   — zod schema enforced at curator setup time when the
 *                       pack is bound to a `NewtonPolicyData`.
 * - `wasmArgsSchema` — zod schema enforced per call when the SDK builds the
 *                       intent and forwards `wasmArgs` to the gateway.
 * - `secretsSchema`  — zod schema enforced at upload-time. Validates the
 *                       shape of the secrets the operator stores in the AVS.
 * - `encodeParams` / `decodeParams` — ABI round-trip for the on-chain
 *                       `policyParams` bytes. Must round-trip cleanly so the
 *                       SDK can read the on-chain value back and confirm it
 *                       matches the curator's intended config.
 * - `prepareQuery`   — optional. When present, the SDK invokes it on every
 *                       call to gather chain-state freshness inputs. Packs
 *                       that don't need this (e.g. KYC-only packs) omit it.
 *                       The optional second `options` argument is a typed-
 *                       per-pack escape hatch for per-call overrides — e.g.
 *                       VaultsFYI's `previousAllocationHash` for freshness
 *                       binding. Each concrete pack narrows it via its own
 *                       `prepareQuery` signature; the shared interface keeps
 *                       it `unknown` so the SDK can forward it verbatim.
 * - `deployments`    — `chainId → Deployment` map sliced from the upstream
 *                       `deployments.json` for this pack only. Typed as
 *                       `Partial<Record<ChainId, Deployment>>` so callers
 *                       must handle `undefined` for unsupported chains
 *                       rather than silently reading `.policy` off nothing.
 *                       Use `getDeployment(pack, chainId)` from this package
 *                       for the safe lookup.
 * - `metadata`       — static identity from the pack's `policy_metadata.json`.
